# SbNgBrowsergames

The app is running live on: 
https://rd-browsergames.onrender.com/


This is a junior full-stack project using Angular 16.2.1 as the frontend, Java 20 (Spring Boot 3.1.4) as the backend, MySQL 8.0.34 as the database, and Docker for packaging and hosting.

This was my very first time deploying an application. Now that I know Docker Compose exists, I realized it was unnecessary to generate the frontend and backend projects in the same folder. Next time, I won't do that. :)
However, you can find the Java source code under src/main, and Angular under src/app.

Among many things, I should get to know Angular structures better. I learned many things about components and services during the development of this application, so in my future ones, I can plan the project structure and class responsibilities way better.
Please note that I am still learning.
